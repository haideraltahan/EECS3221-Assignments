NAME

simul - create N pthreads program that evaluates some aspects of the pthreads system and prints some related statistics.

SYNOSPIS

./simul [-L] FLOAT [-M] FLOAT [-T] INTEGER [-N] INTEGER

DESCRIPTION

-L: is the λ (float). Default is 0.1
-M: is the µ (float). Default is 0.2
-N: is the number of philosophers (integer). Default is 5
-T: is the number of clock ticks (integer). Default is 100

simul creates N threads that behave as philosophers. Every philosopher executing cycles after waking. Each philosopher can be in one of three states: THINK, HUNGRY or EATING. If he is in THINK state he invokes randomly based on λ. If the random number is less than λ he switches to HUNGRY. If he is in HUNGRY state he will switch to EATING state when the chopsticks become available. If the philosopher is in EATING state he invokes the randomly based µ. If the random number is less than µ he switches back to THINK state.
