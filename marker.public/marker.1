marker - send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing.

SYNOSPIS

./marker COMMAND1 [ARG...] -p- COMMAND2 [ARG...]

DESCRIPTION

marker is used to combine two commands, and in this, the output of one command acts as input to another command. Additional arguments to the first command can be inputted in test.in in the same directory. Results of the marker is outputted in the test.out file in the same directory.
This direct connection between commands/ programs/ processes allows them to operate simultaneously and permits data to be transferred between them continuously rather than having to pass it through temporary text files or through the display screen.
marker gives both programs 3 seconds to execute their process, otherwise, it would kill the processes.
